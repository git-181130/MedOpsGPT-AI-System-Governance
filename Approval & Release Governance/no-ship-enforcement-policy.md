# No-Ship Enforcement Policy  
## Mandatory Containment of Critical Risk  

---

## Purpose

This document defines the enforcement rules governing No-Ship decisions.

A No-Ship decision is not advisory.

It is binding.

This policy ensures that when a critical risk (R3) is identified, deployment is halted until the risk is eliminated and verified through structured mitigation and regression.

No-Ship exists to protect users, not timelines.

---

## Definition of No-Ship

A No-Ship decision occurs when:

- Any evaluation track produces an unresolved R3 severity
- Regression validation fails
- Boundary enforcement collapses
- Escalation integrity is compromised
- Critical misinformation remains present

No-Ship means deployment is prohibited.

---

## Automatic No-Ship Triggers

The following conditions automatically result in No-Ship:

- Diagnostic confirmation in a boundary-restricted context
- Unsafe medication or dosage guidance
- Escalation weakening in emergency scenarios
- Misinformation that could influence health decisions
- Systemic instability across turns
- Reproducible collapse under pressure

No discretionary interpretation is permitted.

---

## Enforcement Actions

When No-Ship is triggered:

1. Release is halted immediately
2. Incident lifecycle is initiated
3. Root cause analysis becomes mandatory
4. The mitigation plan must be documented
5. Regression testing must be completed
6. Governance sign-off required before reconsideration

Deployment cannot proceed during containment.

---

## Override Prohibition

A No-Ship decision cannot be overridden by:

- Executive instruction
- Commercial pressure
- Growth targets
- Competitive deadlines
- Model performance improvements in unrelated tracks

Override requires:

- Re-execution of the affected evaluation track
- Reclassification under frozen governance rules
- Documented validation that the R3 condition no longer exists

Informal override invalidates governance integrity.

---

## Reconsideration Criteria

A No-Ship decision may be lifted only if:

- Root cause has been addressed
- Mitigation implemented successfully
- Regression validated across relevant tracks
- No new R3 exposure introduced
- Residual risk does not meet critical criteria
- Formal governance approval granted

All conditions must be satisfied.

---

## Containment Integrity

If the system is already deployed:

- Containment measures must be evaluated immediately
- Risk exposure must be assessed
- Mitigation timeline accelerated
- Monitoring sensitivity increased

User safety supersedes deployment continuity.

---

## Documentation Requirements

No-Ship decisions must be recorded:

- Triggering severity
- Impacted track
- Failure pattern classification
- Risk state
- Mitigation plan
- Regression status
- Final reconsideration decision

This preserves audit defensibility.

---

## Final Principle

- No-Ship is not a failure.
- No-Ship is functioning correctly.
- If a system is unsafe to deploy, it must not deploy.

Safety discipline is measured by the willingness to stop.
