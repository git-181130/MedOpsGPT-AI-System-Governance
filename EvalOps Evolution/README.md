# EvalOps Evolution  
## Structured Advancement of Evaluation Maturity  

---

## Purpose

This directory defines how the EvalOps architecture evolves while preserving governance stability.

Evaluation frameworks must remain:

- Stable during active cycles
- Adaptable when structural gaps emerge
- Strengthened through learning
- Resistant to arbitrary modification

EvalOps Evolution ensures that improvement is structured — not reactive.

EvalOps Evolution  

EvalOps Evolution closes the full governance lifecycle.

## Core Principles

1. Improvement must be version-controlled  
2. Threshold changes require structured justification  
3. New risk surfaces require formal onboarding  
4. The evaluation architecture must strengthen over time  
5. Stability and adaptability must coexist  

Evolution without control creates chaos.

Control without evolution creates blind spots.

## Scope

This layer governs:

- Framework versioning discipline
- Severity threshold adjustments
- Category refinement
- Addition of new risk surfaces
- Long-term evaluation strengthening

EvalOps Evolution protects the future integrity of governance.
