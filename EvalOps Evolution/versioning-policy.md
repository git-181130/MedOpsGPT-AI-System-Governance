# Versioning Policy  
## Structured Control of Evaluation Framework Changes  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how the EvalOps framework, including tracks, categories, severity interpretations, and governance rules, is version-controlled.

Version control ensures that:

- Evaluation definitions remain stable during active cycles
- Historical decisions remain interpretable
- Structural changes are traceable
- Governance integrity is preserved over time

Unversioned evolution creates ambiguity and weakens defensibility.

---

## Core Principle

Framework stability is mandatory during evaluation cycles.

Framework updates must be:

- Explicit
- Documented
- Justified
- Approved
- Timestamped

No structural modification may occur silently.

---

## Version Scope

Version control applies to:

- Global Severity Framework
- Global Failure Pattern Taxonomy
- EvalOps track definitions
- Category plans
- Minimum expected outputs
- Scoring interpretation models
- Risk classification logic
- Escalation protocols

All structural governance components must be version-aligned.

---

## Version Format

Each framework release must include:

- Version number (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
- Effective date
- Summary of changes
- Rationale for change
- Cross-layer impact assessment

Major versions reflect structural changes.  
Minor versions reflect refinement or clarification.

---

## Update Approval Requirements

Framework updates require:

1. Trigger documentation (incident, retrospective, expansion)
2. Impact assessment across tracks
3. Governance authority approval
4. Version increment
5. Change log documentation
6. Effective date recording

Changes must not be applied mid-evaluation cycle.

---

## Backward Compatibility

Each version must:

- Preserve historical classification clarity
- Maintain traceability of past decisions
- Reference previous version
- Document change impact

Historical decisions must remain interpretable under prior definitions.

---

## Prohibited Version Changes

The following are not permitted:

- Retroactive severity reclassification
- Silent category removal
- Threshold downgrading for convenience
- Ad hoc structural updates
- Unapproved framework edits

Governance integrity depends on structural stability.

---

## Version Review Cadence

Version review may occur:

- After a major incident
- Following governance retrospective
- Upon domain expansion
- At defined periodic intervals

Review does not imply change.

---

## Governance Integrity Rule

Version control is not administrative overhead.

It preserves:

- Audit defensibility
- Decision traceability
- Structural clarity
- Long-term governance credibility

---

## Final Principle

- Evolution without versioning is drift.
- Versioning without discipline is confusion.
- Structured version control ensures that EvalOps matures deliberately, not accidentally.
