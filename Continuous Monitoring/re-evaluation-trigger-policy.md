# Re-Evaluation Trigger Policy  
## When Monitoring Escalates Back to Formal Evaluation  

---

## Purpose

This document defines the conditions under which Continuous Monitoring must escalate into full or partial re-execution of EvalOps tracks.

Monitoring detects signals.  
Re-evaluation validates safety posture under structured governance.

This policy ensures that emerging risk does not remain under informal observation.

When predefined triggers are met, structured evaluation resumes.

---

## Core Principle

Monitoring observes.

Evaluation enforces.

When risk signals exceed defined thresholds, the system must re-enter formal evaluation.

---

## Re-Evaluation Triggers

Re-evaluation is required under the following conditions:

---

###  Critical Drift Detection

- Behaviour previously classified as PASS now meets R3 criteria
- Escalation integrity weakens materially
- Boundary collapse is observed
- Hallucination exposure increases significantly

Trigger Action:
Immediate re-execution of affected track(s).

---

###  Reproducible R2 Pattern Expansion

- Repeated R2 findings in the same category
- Controlled risk increases in frequency
- Weakness spreads across related tracks

Trigger Action:
Systemic review and partial re-evaluation.

---

###  Model or Configuration Update

- Model weights updated
- Prompt strategy materially changed
- Policy logic modified
- Escalation rules refined

Trigger Action:
Targeted regression and evaluation re-execution.

---

###  Domain Scope Expansion

- New symptom categories introduced
- Broader medical domain coverage enabled
- Increased clinical complexity

Trigger Action:
Pre-release evaluation under relevant tracks.

Scope expansion requires fresh evaluation.

---

###  Regulatory or Policy Revision

- Severity framework updated
- Failure taxonomy expanded
- Governance thresholds modified

Trigger Action:
Re-evaluation under the new framework version.

---

###  Incident Lifecycle Activation

- Confirmed R3 in monitoring
- User-impacting safety event
- Boundary breach in production

Trigger Action:
Full re-evaluation of affected tracks.

---

## Re-Evaluation Scope Determination

Scope is determined by:

- Risk surface affected
- Severity classification
- Cross-track exposure potential
- Deployment scale

Re-evaluation may be:

- Category-level
- Track-level
- Multi-track
- Full governance cycle

---

## Version Control Requirement

All re-evaluations must reference:

- Framework version
- Model version
- Configuration state
- Monitoring trigger source

This preserves traceability.

---

## Escalation Integrity Rule

Re-evaluation cannot be deferred due to:

- Timeline pressure
- Operational convenience
- Resource limitations
- Stakeholder preference

Trigger activation requires a response.

---

## Final Principle

A system is safe only if it remains safe under change.

Re-evaluation ensures that safety posture is:

- Reconfirmed
- Revalidated
- Reenforced

- Monitoring identifies risk. Re-evaluation governs it.

Continuous oversight completes the lifecycle.
