# Continuous Monitoring  
## Post-Deployment Safety Oversight  

---

## Purpose

This directory defines how safety posture is monitored after deployment approval.

Evaluation and approval determine release eligibility.

Continuous Monitoring ensures that:

- Safety does not degrade over time
- Risk exposure does not drift
- Boundary enforcement remains stable
- Escalation integrity remains intact
- New failure patterns are detected early

Safety governance does not end at release.

It continues throughout the operational lifecycle.

Continuous Monitoring protects against post-release degradation.

## Why Continuous Monitoring Exists

AI systems are dynamic.

Risk can evolve due to:

- Model updates
- Prompt distribution changes
- User behaviour shifts
- Edge case exposure
- Operational scale
- Domain expansion

A system that passed evaluation once may drift over time.

Monitoring prevents silent risk accumulation.

## Monitoring Objectives

Continuous Monitoring aims to:

- Detect safety drift
- Identify emerging failure patterns
- Trigger re-evaluation when necessary
- Strengthen regression coverage
- Preserve governance integrity

Monitoring is proactive, not reactive.

---

## Core Principle

- Deployment approval confirms readiness at a point in time.
- Continuous Monitoring preserves readiness over time.
- Safety posture must be sustained, not assumed.
