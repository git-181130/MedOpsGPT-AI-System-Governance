# Risk Management  
## Translating Evaluation Outcomes into Controlled Release Decisions  

---

## Purpose

This directory defines how evaluation findings are translated into structured operational risk decisions.

EvalOps identifies unsafe behaviour.  
Risk Management determines what that behaviour means for deployment readiness.

Risk classification alone does not control harm.  
Structured risk control does.

This layer ensures that:

- Severity classifications are operationalised
- Risk posture is explicitly defined
- Mitigation is mandatory when required
- Residual risk is acknowledged and documented
- Release decisions are structured and defensible

Risk Management functions as the bridge between evaluation and approval governance.

## Position Within Governance Architecture

The governance flow operates as follows:

Policy & Standards  
↓  
EvalOps Detection & Classification  
↓  
Risk Management  
↓  
Approval & Release Governance  

Risk Management converts evaluation severity into enforceable deployment posture.

## Scope of Risk Management

This layer governs:

- Risk state classification (Acceptable / Controlled / Critical)
- Escalation rules and containment triggers
- Mitigation and regression requirements
- Residual risk documentation
- Structured feed into release approval workflows

It does not redefine severity.
It operationalizes severity.

---

## Core Principle

Risk cannot be averaged.
Risk cannot be minimized through tone or frequency.

Risk must be:

- Classified
- Controlled
- Documented
- Owned
- Enforced

This directory defines how that control occurs.

---

## Governance Intent

The objective of Risk Management is not to eliminate all model error.

The objective is to ensure that unsafe behaviour:

- Is identified
- Is contained
- Is mitigated
- Is verified before re-release

Safety integrity depends on disciplined risk control, not confidence.
