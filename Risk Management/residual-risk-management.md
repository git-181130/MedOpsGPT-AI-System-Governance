# Residual Risk Management  
## Governing What Remains After Mitigation  

---

## Purpose

No complex AI system eliminates all risk.

Residual Risk Management defines how remaining exposure is identified, documented, monitored, and governed after mitigation actions are implemented.

The objective is not to declare a system risk-free.

The objective is to ensure that any remaining risk is:

- Explicitly acknowledged
- Operationally bounded
- Monitored appropriately
- Governed intentionally

Unacknowledged risk is unmanaged risk.

---

## Definition of Residual Risk

Residual risk is the remaining safety exposure after:

- A failure has been identified
- Root cause analysis has been completed
- Mitigation has been implemented
- Regression validation has been executed

Residual risk reflects what remains once reasonable controls are applied.

---

## Residual Risk States

After mitigation, residual exposure may fall into one of the following states:

### 1️⃣ Eliminated Risk

- Root cause fully addressed
- Regression stable
- No remaining exposure identified

Release eligibility may proceed under normal posture.

---

### 2️⃣ Reduced but Controlled Risk

- Risk reduced significantly
- Remaining exposure bounded and understood
- Monitoring sensitivity increased
- No R3 criteria remain

Release may proceed with explicit documentation.

---

### 3️⃣ Operationally Bounded Risk

- Risk cannot be fully eliminated due to system limitations
- Exposure constrained by defined safeguards
- Monitoring heightened
- Re-evaluation triggers defined

Must not meet R3 thresholds.

---

### 4️⃣ Unresolved Critical Risk

- Mitigation incomplete
- Regression unstable
- Exposure still meets R3 criteria

Release remains blocked.

---

## Documentation Requirements

Residual risk records must include:

- Original severity classification
- Summary of root cause
- Mitigation actions taken
- Regression validation outcome
- Remaining exposure description
- Monitoring adjustments implemented

Residual risk must be written, not implied.

---

## Residual Risk Acceptance Criteria

Residual risk may be accepted only if:

- It does not meet R3 criteria
- It does not undermine safety boundaries
- It does not weaken emergency escalation
- It does not introduce misinformation risk
- It is documented and monitored

Residual risk cannot be accepted for:

- Diagnostic leakage
- Unsafe medication guidance
- Escalation weakening
- Life-threatening misinformation

---

## Monitoring Adjustments

Where residual risk exists:

- Monitoring thresholds may be tightened
- Re-evaluation cadence may increase
- Related tracks may receive additional scrutiny
- Regression scope may expand in future cycles

Residual risk modifies monitoring posture.

---

## Governance Principle

Residual risk is not a loophole.

It is a controlled acknowledgement of system limits.

Acceptance requires documentation, monitoring, and accountability.

---

## Final Statement

Safety maturity is not defined by the absence of risk.

It is defined by:

- Clear acknowledgment of remaining exposure
- Transparent documentation
- Structured monitoring
- Governance ownership

Residual risk management preserves integrity after mitigation.
