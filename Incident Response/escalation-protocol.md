# Escalation Protocol  
## Authority Expansion During Safety Incidents  

---

## Purpose

- This document defines how safety incidents escalate across governance roles and decision authority levels.
- Incident classification determines severity.
- Escalation protocol determines who must be informed, who must act, and who must authorise next steps.
- Escalation prevents isolation of critical information and ensures proportional response.

---

## Core Principle

Escalation must be:

- Structured
- Role-defined
- Proportional to risk
- Non-discretionary

Escalation cannot depend on individual judgment alone.

---

## Escalation Levels

Escalation is tied to the incident classification level.

---

### Level 1 — Critical Safety Incident

Examples:

- Confirmed R3 behaviour in production
- Boundary violation
- Escalation collapse
- Unsafe medical misinformation

Mandatory Escalation:

1. AI Product Operations & AI System Governance Specialist
2. Engineering Lead
3. Product Leadership
4. Executive Sponsor (if applicable)

Actions:

- Immediate release halt
- Incident lifecycle activation
- Formal containment confirmation
- Structured mitigation plan required

Level 1 escalation is immediate and non-optional.

---

### Level 2 — Controlled Safety Incident

Examples:

- Reproducible R2 weakness
- Pattern cluster in monitoring
- Minor but expanding risk exposure

Mandatory Escalation:

1. Governance Owner
2. Engineering Lead

Optional Notification:

- Product Leadership (if deployment posture affected)

Actions:

- Targeted mitigation plan
- Regression scheduling
- Monitoring sensitivity increase

Escalation may expand if severity increases.

---

### Level 3 — Observational Signal

Examples:

- Watchlist detection
- Isolated drift signal
- Non-reproducible anomaly

Escalation:

- Governance documentation
- Monitoring tracking

No broader escalation unless the pattern strengthens.

---

## Escalation Timing Rules

For Level 1 incidents:

- Escalation must occur immediately upon confirmation
- Notification precedes root cause completion
- Containment confirmation must be documented

For Level 2 incidents:

- Escalation must occur within a defined governance review window

Delay in escalation increases risk exposure.

---

## Escalation Integrity Safeguards

Escalation cannot be delayed due to:

- Timeline pressure
- Perceived reputational concern
- Resource constraints
- Internal disagreement

If classification meets the threshold, escalation must occur.

---

## Escalation During Reclassification

If incident severity increases during investigation:

- Escalation must expand accordingly
- Additional authority levels must be informed
- Containment posture must adjust

Downward reclassification requires documented evidence and governance review.

---

## Documentation Requirements

Each escalation event must record:

- Incident identifier
- Severity level
- Escalation tier
- Notified roles
- Timestamp
- Immediate actions taken

Escalation without documentation weakens accountability.

---

## Final Principle

Escalation ensures that critical safety events are not contained within a single role or team.

Structured escalation protects:

- Users
- Governance integrity
- Organisational accountability

In high-risk AI systems, silence is risk.

Escalation ensures visibility, authority, and a disciplined response.
