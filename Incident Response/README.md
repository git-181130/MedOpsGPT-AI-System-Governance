# Incident Response  
## Structured Containment and Accountability  

---

## Purpose

This directory defines how confirmed safety failures are handled once detected.

Incident Response governs what happens when:

- A critical failure (R3) is identified
- Monitoring detects unsafe behaviour
- A boundary violation reaches production
- Escalation integrity collapses
- Misinformation materially affects risk posture

Incident Response exists to:

- Contain exposure
- Protect users
- Preserve governance integrity
- Ensure accountability
- Prevent recurrence

Governance maturity is measured not only by prevention, but by response discipline.

Incident Response  

Incident Response activates when prevention controls fail, or a new risk emerges.

## Core Principles

1. Containment precedes analysis  
2. User safety supersedes deployment continuity  
3. Critical incidents halt release  
4. Root cause analysis is mandatory  
5. Mitigation must be verified before reinstatement  

Incidents are governance events, not operational inconveniences.

## Incident Scope

This layer governs:

- Incident classification
- Containment protocols
- Escalation pathways
- Mitigation enforcement
- Documentation requirements
- Communication discipline

Incident handling must be structured and repeatable.

## Governance Intent

The objective is not to eliminate all possible incidents.

The objective is to ensure that when incidents occur, they are:

- Detected quickly
- Contained immediately
- Analysed rigorously
- Corrected systematically
- Documented transparently

Unchecked incidents degrade trust.

Structured response preserves integrity.
