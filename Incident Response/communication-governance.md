# Communication Governance  
## Structured Information Control During Safety Incidents  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how safety incidents are communicated internally and, where applicable, externally.

Clear communication preserves:

- User safety
- Organisational clarity
- Governance integrity
- Audit defensibility
- Trust

Unstructured communication during incidents can amplify harm.

---

## Core Principle

Communication must be:

- Accurate
- Controlled
- Timely
- Proportional
- Role-defined

Speculation is prohibited.
Assumptions are documented as preliminary.

---

## Communication Objectives

During an incident, communication must:

1. Confirm containment status  
2. Clarify risk exposure scope  
3. Prevent misinformation  
4. Preserve evidence integrity  
5. Define next actions  
6. Maintain governance authority clarity  

Communication supports response but, not replace it.

---

## Internal Communication Protocol

For Level 1 incidents:

- Governance authority notified immediately
- Engineering informed of containment status
- Product leadership informed of deployment halt
- Monitoring posture updated

All communication must reference:

- Incident classification
- Severity level
- Current containment status
- Next required action

For Level 2 incidents:

- Governance review required
- Engineering coordination required
- Monitoring posture adjusted

Level 3 signals require documentation but limited escalation.

---

## External Communication Principles (If Applicable)

If user-facing impact occurs:

- Communication must be factual
- Impact scope must be described accurately
- No speculative root cause statements
- No premature reassurances
- No minimisation of risk

External communication must align with verified facts.

---

## Information Control Safeguards

During an active incident:

- Root cause hypotheses must be labelled as provisional
- No severity reclassification without formal governance review
- No public claims of resolution without regression validation

Communication cannot override a structured investigation.

---

## Documentation Requirements

All formal communication must record:

- Timestamp
- Sender role
- Audience
- Summary of message
- Referenced evidence
- Action commitments

Traceability preserves audit defensibility.

---

## Escalation Communication Rule

If the incident escalates in severity:

- Communication must reflect the updated classification
- Stakeholders must be informed promptly
- Monitoring posture must be updated accordingly

Silence during escalation undermines governance integrity.

---

## Closure Communication

Upon incident closure:

- Root cause summary documented
- Mitigation actions confirmed
- Regression validation confirmed
- Residual risk posture clarified
- Approval decision referenced

Closure communication must confirm restored safety posture.

---

## Final Principle

- During incidents, clarity protects integrity.
- Communication must support structured governance, not bypass it.
- Transparency without discipline creates risk.
- Discipline without communication creates confusion.
- Structured communication preserves trust and safety.
