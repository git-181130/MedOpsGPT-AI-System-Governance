# Containment and Mitigation Policy  
## Immediate Risk Control During Safety Incidents  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how risk is immediately contained and systematically mitigated when a safety incident is confirmed.

Containment protects users.  
Mitigation restores system integrity.

Containment is immediate.  
Mitigation is structured.

---

## Core Principle

When safety is uncertain, exposure must be reduced immediately.

Containment precedes analysis.
Mitigation follows root cause identification.

Deployment continuity is secondary to user safety.

---

## Containment Objectives

Containment aims to:

- Prevent further unsafe exposure
- Stop propagation of critical behaviour
- Isolate the affected configuration
- Preserve evidence for analysis
- Stabilise risk posture

Containment is mandatory for Level 1 incidents.

---

## Immediate Containment Actions

For Level 1 (Critical) incidents:

1. Release halt enforced
2. Deployment paused (if applicable)
3. Affected configuration isolated
4. Incident lifecycle formally activated
5. Governance authority notified

For Level 2 incidents:

- Monitoring sensitivity increased
- Risk surface isolated for targeted review
- Temporary constraints applied if required

Containment must not be delayed pending investigation.

---

## Mitigation Principles

Mitigation must:

- Directly address the root cause
- Eliminate the identified failure pathway
- Avoid introducing new risk exposure
- Be documented clearly
- Be validated through regression

Superficial mitigation is insufficient.

---

## Acceptable Mitigation Actions

Mitigation may include:

- Model behaviour adjustments
- Prompt logic reinforcement
- Escalation strengthening
- Refusal calibration tightening
- Policy clarification
- Category refinement
- Taxonomy update (if systemic gap identified)

Mitigation must align with the governance framework.

---

## Mitigation Validation Requirements

Before release reconsideration:

- Root cause must be documented
- Mitigation must be implemented
- Relevant tracks must be re-executed
- Cross-track stability must be assessed
- No new R3 exposure may exist

Validation is mandatory for critical incidents.

---

## Cross-Track Mitigation Review

Mitigation must not:

- Weaken escalation integrity
- Increase hallucination exposure
- Introduce diagnostic leakage
- Degrade factual accuracy
- Destabilise refusal behaviour

All adjacent risk surfaces must be reviewed.

---

## Partial Mitigation Prohibition

Partial mitigation may not justify:

- Conditional release of critical exposure
- Downgrading severity without evidence
- Closing the incident prematurely

Critical risk must be eliminated, not reduced.

---

## Documentation Requirements

Containment and mitigation records must include:

- Incident classification
- Containment actions taken
- Root cause summary
- Mitigation details
- Regression results
- Governance approval status

Documentation ensures accountability.

---

## Final Principle

- Containment protects users.
- Mitigation restores safety.
- Neither can be skipped.

Governance maturity is demonstrated by a disciplined response under pressure.

Safety integrity must be restored before deployment resumes.
