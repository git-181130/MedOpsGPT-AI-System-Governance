# Systemic vs Surface Failure Model  
## Distinguishing Isolated Behaviour from Structural Weakness  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how to determine whether a confirmed safety incident represents:

- A surface-level failure (localised anomaly), or
- A systemic failure (structural weakness in governance or model behaviour)

Correct classification determines the scope of corrective action and regression.

Misclassifying systemic failures as surface issues leads to recurrence.

---

## Core Principle

A surface failure is a symptom.

A systemic failure is a structural weakness that allows symptoms to recur.

Effective governance must identify which type occurred.

---

## Surface Failure Characteristics

A failure may be classified as surface-level if:

- It is non-reproducible under structured testing
- It does not appear across similar prompts
- It does not generalise across categories
- It does not weaken escalation or boundary integrity
- It does not reflect taxonomy or policy gaps
- It resolves fully with localised mitigation

Surface failures are typically:

- Context-specific
- Linguistically narrow
- Prompt-sensitive
- Contained within a single track

Surface failures still require mitigation and regression.

---

## Systemic Failure Characteristics

A failure may be classified as systemic if:

- It is reproducible across prompts
- It spans multiple categories
- It appears across multiple tracks
- It exposes a governance blind spot
- It reveals ambiguity in the minimum expected outputs
- It reflects escalation or boundary instability
- It indicates a monitoring gap
- It reappears after mitigation

Systemic failures require structural correction.

## Systemic Failure Types

Common systemic failure sources include:

1. Escalation Calibration Gap  
2. Boundary Enforcement Weakness  
3. Failure Pattern Taxonomy Gap  
4. Incomplete Category Coverage  
5. Monitoring Sensitivity Insufficiency  
6. Cross-Track Interaction Instability  
7. Policy Ambiguity  
8. Regression Scope Insufficiency  

Systemic causes require architecture-level response.

## Determination Methodology

To classify a failure:

1. Attempt structured reproduction
2. Test across adjacent categories
3. Evaluate cross-track stability
4. Review prior incident history
5. Assess whether existing controls were sufficient

If multiple conditions persist, classify as systemic. When uncertain, classify upward (systemic).

## Response Differences

Surface Failure Response:

- Localised mitigation
- Targeted regression
- Documentation
- Monitoring adjustment

Systemic Failure Response:

- Framework review
- Category redefinition (if required)
- Escalation model reassessment
- Monitoring threshold adjustment
- Cross-track regression expansion
- Governance update documentation

Systemic failures require broader correction.

---

## Governance Integrity Rule

- Repeated surface failures in similar domains may indicate systemic weakness.
- Do not assume isolation without testing.
- Failure clustering is a systemic signal.

---

## Final Principle

- Superficial fixes reduce noise.
- Systemic fixes reduce risk.
- Governance maturity depends on the ability to recognise when a failure reflects deeper structural exposure.

Correct classification prevents recurrence.
