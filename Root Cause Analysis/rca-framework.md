# Root Cause Analysis Framework  
## Structured Identification of Underlying Failure Drivers  

---

## Purpose

This document defines the structured methodology used to identify the true underlying causes of confirmed safety incidents.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) must determine:

- Why did the failure occur?
- Why did existing controls not prevent it?
- Whether the failure was isolated or systemic?
- What corrective actions prevent recurrence?

RCA must go beyond symptom correction.

---

## Core Principle

The visible failure is rarely the root cause. The root cause is the underlying system, governance, or structural condition that allowed the failure to occur.
Effective RCA eliminates recurrence pathways.

---

## RCA Stages

Root Cause Analysis follows five structured stages:

1. Incident Reconstruction  
2. Failure Mapping  
3. Cause Identification  
4. Systemic Assessment  
5. Corrective Action Definition  

Each stage must be documented.

---

## Stage 1 — Incident Reconstruction

Reconstruct:

- Exact prompt sequence
- System response behaviour
- Contextual signals
- Escalation phrasing
- Boundary interaction
- Severity classification

Objective:

Understand precisely what occurred without reinterpretation.

Assumptions are prohibited at this stage.

---

## Stage 2 — Failure Mapping

Map observed behaviour to:

- Relevant EvalOps track
- Failure pattern taxonomy family
- Severity classification
- Category definition

This anchors the incident within the governance structure.

---

## Stage 3 — Cause Identification

Apply structured questioning (e.g., 5 Whys methodology):

- Why did this behaviour occur?
- Why did mitigation controls fail?
- Why was escalation insufficient?
- Why was boundary logic bypassed?
- Why was the failure not detected earlier?

Root cause categories may include:

- Prompt logic weakness
- Policy ambiguity
- Escalation calibration gap
- Refusal instability
- Insufficient category coverage
- Monitoring sensitivity gap
- Cross-track interaction flaw

Root cause must be singular or clearly structured if multiple layers exist.

---

## Stage 4 — Systemic Assessment

Determine whether the failure was:

- Isolated (surface-level anomaly)
- Reproducible under similar conditions
- Cross-track influential
- Indicative of the taxonomy gap
- Indicative of governance design weakness

Systemic causes require a structural response.

Surface causes may require localised mitigation.

---

## Stage 5 — Corrective Action Definition

Corrective actions must:

- Directly address the identified root cause
- Prevent recurrence pathway
- Avoid introducing new exposure
- Be verifiable through regression

Corrective action may include:

- Escalation strengthening
- Boundary reinforcement
- Category refinement
- Monitoring threshold adjustment
- Taxonomy update
- Evaluation framework update

Corrective action must be traceable to the root cause.

---

## RCA Integrity Rules

RCA must not:

- Stop at the first plausible explanation
- Attribute cause to user phrasing alone
- Rely solely on mitigation patching
- Skip systemic review for critical incidents
- Downgrade severity without structured review

Root cause identification must be evidence-based.

---

## Documentation Requirements

Each RCA record must include:

- Incident identifier
- Severity classification
- Failure pattern mapping
- Root cause statement
- Systemic vs surface determination
- Corrective action plan
- Regression validation outcome

Traceability preserves governance maturity.

---

## Final Principle

- Mitigation corrects the present.
- Root Cause Analysis protects the future.

A system improves only when the true cause of failure is eliminated, not merely suppressed.
