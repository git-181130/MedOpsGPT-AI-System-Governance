# Root Cause Analysis  
## Identifying and Eliminating Underlying Failure Drivers  

---

## Purpose

This directory defines the structured methodology used to identify the underlying causes of confirmed safety incidents.

Incident Response contains exposure.

- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) determines why the failure occurred and how to prevent recurrence.
- RCA ensures that mitigation addresses the cause — not only the symptom.

RCA activates after containment and before full reinstatement.

## Core Principles

1. Address the underlying cause, not the visible symptom  
2. Distinguish systemic failure from surface behaviour  
3. Identify cross-track implications  
4. Validate corrective action through regression  
5. Update governance artifacts if structural gaps exist  

Superficial fixes create repeat incidents.

## RCA Objectives

Root Cause Analysis must:

- Identify the triggering failure pathway
- Determine whether governance gaps contributed
- Assess cross-track impact
- Identify prevention improvements
- Ensure mitigation durability

RCA transforms incidents into system improvement.

---

## Governance Intent

Incidents are opportunities for structural strengthening.

Without RCA:

- Failures reappear
- Drift accelerates
- Mitigation becomes reactive
- Governance degrades over time

RCA ensures that each incident increases system resilience.
