# Failure Pattern Update Policy  
## Controlled Evolution of the Global Failure Taxonomy  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how new failure patterns are incorporated into the Global Failure Pattern Taxonomy following confirmed incidents or systemic discoveries.

The taxonomy must remain:

- Stable during evaluation cycles
- Structured
- Version-controlled
- Resistant to ad hoc expansion
- Adaptable when genuine gaps are identified

Failure taxonomy evolution must be deliberate — not reactive.

---

## Core Principle

A failure pattern should only be added or modified when:

- It represents a distinct harm pathway
- It cannot be adequately captured by existing families
- It is reproducible or systemic
- It has governance implications

Taxonomy growth must strengthen clarity, not dilute it.

---

## Trigger Conditions for Taxonomy Review

Taxonomy review may be triggered when:

1. Root Cause Analysis identifies a new structural failure class  
2. Repeated incidents cluster under ambiguous mapping  
3. A surface failure exposes a classification gap  
4. Monitoring detects an unclassified pattern cluster  
5. Cross-track systemic exposure is identified  

Isolated anomalies do not justify taxonomy modification.

---

## Taxonomy Update Process

When review is triggered:

1. Document observed pattern clearly  
2. Attempt mapping to existing failure families  
3. Assess overlap with current definitions  
4. Determine whether refinement or a new category is required  
5. Draft updated definition with harm pathway clarity  
6. Version-control the taxonomy  
7. Update affected evaluation tracks if necessary  

Updates must preserve backward traceability.

---

## Refinement vs Addition

Refinement may be appropriate when:

- Definition ambiguity exists
- Subtype clarification improves clarity
- Language tightening improves enforcement

New failure family addition may be appropriate when:

- Harm pathway is materially distinct
- Existing taxonomy cannot capture the pattern
- Systemic recurrence demonstrates a structural gap

Expansion must be justified, not assumed.

---

## Governance Controls

Taxonomy modifications require:

- Root Cause Analysis documentation reference
- Governance authority approval
- Version update annotation
- Cross-track impact assessment

Taxonomy must not change mid-evaluation cycle.

---

## Backward Compatibility

When taxonomy is updated:

- Previous incident classifications must remain interpretable
- Version history must be preserved
- Evaluation records must reference the taxonomy version

Stability preserves audit integrity.

---

## Prohibited Changes

The following are not permitted:

- Removing failure families to reduce perceived exposure
- Downgrading definitions for convenience
- Retroactive reclassification without a documented basis
- Ad hoc additions without root cause documentation

Governance stability protects credibility.

---

## Final Principle

- static taxonomy creates blind spots.
- An unstable taxonomy creates chaos.

Controlled evolution ensures that governance becomes stronger with each incident.

Every structural failure should strengthen the system.
