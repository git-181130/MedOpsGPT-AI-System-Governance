# Contributing Guidelines  
## Governance-Aligned Contribution Model  

---

## Purpose

This repository documents a structured AI System Governance architecture for high-risk domains.

Contributions are welcome, but must align with the core principles of:

- Deterministic enforcement
- Severity integrity
- Structural clarity
- Version-controlled evolution
- Non-substitutable safety controls

This is not a feature-driven repository.

It is a governance architecture.

---

## Contribution Philosophy

Contributions must strengthen:

- Clarity
- Coverage
- Enforcement logic
- Structural consistency
- Documentation precision

Contributions must not weaken:

- Severity definitions
- Stop rules
- Escalation discipline
- Release gating integrity
- Monitoring sensitivity

Governance stability is non-negotiable.

---

## Acceptable Contribution Types

Contributions may include:

- Clarification of governance documentation
- Refinement of definitions for precision
- Structured improvements to readability
- Documentation enhancements
- Taxonomy gap identification (with justification)
- Monitoring sensitivity improvement proposals
- Cross-layer consistency improvements

All contributions must preserve enforcement strength.

---

## Restricted Contribution Types

The following are not permitted without formal governance review:

- Relaxation of severity thresholds
- Downgrading R3 criteria
- Removal of failure categories
- Modification of No-Ship enforcement rules
- Structural weakening of escalation protocols
- Ad hoc addition of overlapping risk surfaces

Structural enforcement integrity must be preserved.

---

## Contribution Process

1. Submit a structured proposal or pull request.
2. Clearly describe:
   - The change
   - The rationale
   - The governance layer affected
   - Cross-track implications
3. Reference any triggering incident or retrospective (if applicable).
4. Include impact analysis for:
   - Severity enforcement
   - Risk classification
   - Monitoring posture
   - Release governance
5. Await governance review and approval.

Changes may require version increment documentation.

---

## Version Control Requirements

Any structural modification must:

- Reference current framework version
- Document change rationale
- Preserve backward interpretability
- Include version update notes

Framework changes may not occur mid-evaluation cycle.

---

## Documentation Standards

All contributions must:

- Use precise language
- Avoid ambiguous terminology
- Maintain consistent tone
- Align with existing governance structure
- Preserve cross-layer coherence

Clarity supports enforcement.

---

## Governance Review

Final approval authority resides with:
- AI Product Operations & AI System Governance

Approval decisions will assess:

- Safety impact
- Structural alignment
- Enforcement preservation
- Long-term governance integrity

Governance decisions are binding.

---

## Code of Conduct

All discussions must remain:

- Professional
- Evidence-based
- Non-personal
- Governance-focused

Debate is welcome. Dilution of safety posture is not.

---

## Final Principle

- This repository represents a structured AI Safety Governance model.
- Contributions must improve resilience, clarity, and enforcement, not convenience.
- If a proposed change weakens safety boundaries, it will not be accepted.
- Governance integrity takes precedence over expansion.
