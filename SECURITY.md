# Security Policy  
## Responsible Disclosure for Safety Vulnerabilities  

---

## Purpose

This repository documents governance architecture for high-risk AI systems.

If you identify a potential safety vulnerability, structural weakness, or governance gap, responsible disclosure is required.

Publicly posting exploit pathways or harmful scenarios without disclosure review is discouraged.

---

## What Constitutes a Security Concern

Security-related concerns may include:

- Critical failure pathways not covered by evaluation tracks
- Escalation collapse scenarios
- Boundary bypass mechanisms
- Systemic taxonomy blind spots
- Severity misclassification risks
- Release gating vulnerabilities
- Monitoring threshold weaknesses
- Incident response loopholes

Security concerns must be reported responsibly.

---

## Reporting Process

If you discover a vulnerability:

1. Do not publicly disclose the issue immediately.
2. Provide a structured description including:
   - Risk surface affected
   - Reproduction scenario (if applicable)
   - Potential harm pathway
   - Severity assessment
3. Allow governance review and response before public discussion.

This ensures risk containment before exposure.

---

## Response Commitment

Upon receiving a security report:

- The issue will be assessed under the severity framework.
- If validated, incident response protocols may activate.
- Mitigation and regression validation will be required.
- Framework updates will follow version-controlled governance processes.

Security reports strengthen the system.

---

## Non-Exploit Commitment

This repository is intended to strengthen governance discipline.

It must not be used to:

- Develop exploit strategies
- Circumvent escalation safeguards
- Weaken the enforcement logic

Governance transparency must not become vulnerability exposure.

---

## Final Principle

- Responsible disclosure protects users.
- Security integrity depends on disciplined reporting and structured response.
- If in doubt, report privately before public discussion.
