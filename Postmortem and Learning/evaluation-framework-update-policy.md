# Evaluation Framework Update Policy  
## Controlled Evolution of EvalOps Architecture  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how the EvalOps framework may be modified following postmortem findings, governance retrospectives, or systemic failure discoveries.

The evaluation framework must be:

- Stable during active evaluation cycles
- Version-controlled
- Structurally consistent
- Updated only through documented governance processes

Uncontrolled updates weaken audit integrity and decision defensibility.

---

## Core Principle

Framework changes must strengthen clarity and coverage, not reduce exposure visibility.

The evaluation framework must evolve deliberately, not reactively.

---

## Trigger Conditions for Framework Review

Framework updates may be initiated when:

1. Postmortem identifies category coverage gap  
2. Root Cause Analysis reveals taxonomy limitation  
3. Monitoring detects a recurring unclassified pattern  
4. Governance retrospective identifies structural weakness  
5. Domain scope expansion requires a new risk surface  
6. Regulatory expectation shift requires structural alignment  

Isolated anomalies do not justify structural change.

---

## Types of Framework Updates

Framework updates may include:

---

###  Category Refinement

- Clarifying category definitions
- Expanding edge case coverage
- Removing ambiguity in expected outputs

Refinement improves precision.

---

###  Category Addition

- Adding a new risk surface within a track
- Introducing a new failure mode category
- Addressing newly identified harm pathway

Addition requires justification and version control.

---

###  Track Modification

- Expanding the scope of the existing track
- Rebalancing cross-track separation
- Adjusting minimum expected outputs

Track-level updates require cross-track impact review.

---

###  Severity Interpretation Update

- Clarifying threshold definitions
- Refining escalation boundaries
- Adjusting classification examples

Severity semantics must remain stable and well-documented.

---

## Update Governance Process

All framework updates must follow this process:

1. Document triggering event
2. Reference incident or retrospective source
3. Define proposed modification
4. Assess cross-track implications
5. Evaluate monitoring impact
6. Obtain governance authority approval
7. Version-control the update
8. Document effective date

Changes must not occur mid-evaluation cycle.

---

## Version Control Requirements

Each update must:

- Increment framework version
- Preserve historical definitions
- Maintain backward traceability
- Record rationale for change
- Reference related incident or gap

Version stability preserves institutional memory.

---

## Prohibited Changes

The following are not permitted:

- Removing categories to reduce apparent risk
- Downgrading severity definitions without a structured basis
- Retroactively altering historical classifications
- Introducing ambiguous category wording
- Ad hoc changes without documentation

Governance stability is non-negotiable.

---

## Integration with Monitoring and Risk Management

Framework updates must be evaluated for:

- Monitoring threshold alignment
- Drift detection impact
- Regression scope implications
- Escalation protocol interaction

Structural changes must not weaken existing controls.

---

## Governance Integrity Rule

Framework evolution must demonstrate:

- Increased clarity
- Reduced blind spots
- Stronger enforcement
- Improved risk containment

Framework updates are governance improvements, not cosmetic adjustments.

---

## Final Principle

- A static framework creates blind spots.
- An unstable framework creates confusion.
- Controlled evolution ensures that the evaluation architecture becomes stronger with each learning cycle.
- Governance maturity is measured by disciplined adaptation.
