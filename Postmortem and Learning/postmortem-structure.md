# Postmortem Structure  
## Standardised Review Format for Safety Incidents  

---

## Purpose

This document defines the required structure for conducting and documenting a postmortem following a confirmed safety incident.

The objective of a postmortem is to:

- Reflect on systemic adequacy
- Identify control gaps
- Improve governance mechanisms
- Strengthen prevention architecture

A postmortem is not a repeat of Root Cause Analysis.

- RCA identifies why a failure occurred.  
- Postmortem evaluates how governance can improve as a result.

---

## Postmortem Timing

A postmortem must be conducted:

- After the closure of Level 1 incidents
- After systemic Level 2 patterns
- When repeated similar incidents occur
- When structural governance gaps are identified

Postmortem occurs after mitigation and regression are complete.

---

## Required Postmortem Sections

Each postmortem document must include the following sections:

---

###  Incident Summary

- Incident identifier
- Severity level
- Affected evaluation track(s)
- Date detected
- Date contained
- Date closed

This section is factual and concise.

---

###  Root Cause Summary

- Root cause classification
- Systemic vs surface determination
- Failure pattern family
- Summary of corrective action

This section references RCA findings without re-analysis.

---

###  Control Adequacy Assessment

Evaluate whether:

- EvalOps categories were sufficient
- Monitoring sensitivity was adequate
- Escalation occurred in a timely manner
- Risk classification captured severity appropriately
- Release governance was correctly enforced

This section focuses on governance performance.

---

###  Detection Effectiveness Review

Assess:

- How the issue was detected
- Whether detection was timely
- Whether monitoring thresholds were sufficient
- Whether watchlist signals were present earlier

This identifies early-warning gaps.

---

###  Containment & Response Review

Evaluate:

- Was containment immediate?
- Was escalation structured?
- Was communication clear?
- Was mitigation proportional?
- Was the regression thorough?

This measures response maturity.

---

###  Control Gap Identification

Explicitly identify:

- Any policy ambiguity
- Category coverage gaps
- Taxonomy blind spots
- Monitoring threshold insufficiencies
- Cross-track instability not previously anticipated

This section drives structural improvement.

---

###  Governance Improvement Actions

Define:

- Evaluation updates (if required)
- Monitoring adjustments
- Taxonomy refinements
- Escalation threshold changes
- Regression scope enhancements

Improvement actions must be concrete and assigned.

---

###  Lessons Learned

Document:

- What this incident revealed about system behaviour
- What structural weakness was exposed
- What future risk did this incident prevented
- What governance maturity improvement occurred

Learning must be explicit.

---

## Documentation Integrity Requirements

Postmortem documentation must:

- Be version-controlled
- Reference incident ID
- Reference the RCA document
- Be approved by the governance authority
- Be stored alongside incident lifecycle records

Postmortem without documentation does not improve the system.

---

## Governance Integrity Rule

Postmortem must not:

- Assign individual blame
- Minimise systemic exposure
- Reduce severity retroactively
- Omit control gaps for reputational reasons
- Skip improvement action definition

The purpose is structural strengthening.

---

## Final Principle

- An incident becomes valuable only when it improves the system.
- Postmortem converts failure into resilience.

Governance maturity is measured not by the absence of incidents, but by the quality of learning that follows them.
