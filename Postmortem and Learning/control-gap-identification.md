# Control Gap Identification  
## Systematic Detection of Governance Weaknesses  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how structural weaknesses in governance controls are identified following incidents, monitoring findings, or retrospective reviews.

A control gap exists when:

- A failure pathway was not adequately governed
- A detection mechanism was insufficient
- A threshold was too permissive
- A response was delayed or unclear
- A risk surface was under-defined

Identifying control gaps is essential to strengthening the system.

---

## Core Principle

- Incidents are symptoms.
- Control gaps are the structural conditions that allowed them.
- Governance improves only when control gaps are explicitly named and addressed.

---

## Types of Control Gaps

Control gaps may occur across multiple layers:

---

###  Policy Gaps

- Ambiguity in severity definitions
- Incomplete minimum expected outputs
- Inadequate prohibited behaviour definition
- Misalignment between tracks and taxonomy

Policy gaps weaken enforcement clarity.

---

###  Evaluation Coverage Gaps

- Missing category coverage
- Insufficient edge case scenarios
- Incomplete cross-track interaction testing
- Overly narrow scope definition

Coverage gaps allow blind spots.

---

###  Monitoring Gaps

- Drift not detected early
- Watchlist thresholds are too permissive
- Insufficient sampling frequency
- Weak regression triggers

Monitoring gaps delay detection.

---

###  Escalation Gaps

- Delayed authority notification
- Ambiguous escalation criteria
- Informal override attempts
- Role confusion

Escalation gaps weaken response discipline.

---

###  Mitigation & Regression Gaps

- Superficial corrective action
- Incomplete cross-track verification
- Insufficient regression scope
- Lack of monitoring adjustment

Mitigation gaps allow recurrence.

## Gap Identification Methodology

To identify a control gap:

1. Review incident timeline
2. Identify the point where failure should have been detected
3. Determine whether an existing control exists
4. Assess whether control was sufficient
5. Determine if control was executed properly
6. Document structural weakness

Control gaps must be specific, not generalised.

---

## Gap Classification

Each identified control gap must be classified as:

- Minor (localised weakness)
- Moderate (structural adjustment required)
- Critical (systemic governance weakness)

Classification determines improvement urgency.

---

## Documentation Requirements

Each control gap record must include:

- Incident reference (if applicable)
- Governance layer affected
- Description of weakness
- Harm pathway exposure
- Proposed corrective action
- Responsible governance owner
- Target implementation timeline

Documentation ensures accountability.

---

## Governance Improvement Integration

Control gap findings must feed into:

- Taxonomy updates
- Category refinements
- Monitoring threshold adjustments
- Escalation protocol clarification
- Regression scope expansion
- Policy wording refinement

Control gap identification is incomplete without corrective integration.

---

## Governance Integrity Rule

Control gaps must not be minimised to preserve perception.

Governance credibility depends on:

- Honest identification
- Structured documentation
- Visible correction
- Durable reinforcement

Transparency strengthens resilience.

---

## Final Principle

- A mature governance system does not hide weaknesses.
- It identifies them, documents them, and corrects them.
- Control gaps are not reputational risk.
- Unidentified gaps are.
