# Governance Retrospective Model  
## Periodic Structural Review of Safety Controls  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how the overall governance system is periodically reviewed for structural adequacy.

Postmortem reviews individual incidents.  
Governance retrospectives evaluate the system as a whole.

The objective is to assess whether:

- Risk controls remain sufficient
- Monitoring posture remains proportional
- Evaluation coverage remains complete
- Escalation pathways remain effective
- Governance authority remains clear

Retrospective review prevents slow structural degradation.

---

## Core Principle

- Even without major incidents, governance must be reviewed.
- Absence of incidents does not guarantee absence of risk.
- Governance retrospectives ensure long-term integrity.

---

## Retrospective Triggers

Governance retrospectives may occur:

- After major Level 1 incidents
- After systemic Level 2 patterns
- On a defined periodic schedule
- Following significant system updates
- Following domain expansion
- Following policy framework updates

Retrospective review must not depend solely on the crisis.

---

## Retrospective Evaluation Domains

Each retrospective must assess:

---

###  Evaluation Coverage Adequacy

- Are existing categories sufficient?
- Are new harm pathways emerging?
- Are minimum expected outputs still appropriate?
- Is track separation still justified?

---

###  Severity Framework Stability

- Are severity definitions clear?
- Is severity consistently applied?
- Are thresholds appropriate?
- Is highest-severity enforcement intact?

---

###  Monitoring Sensitivity

- Are drift signals detected early?
- Are watchlist patterns appropriately defined?
- Are regression triggers adequate?
- Are monitoring intervals risk-weighted?

---

###  Escalation & Authority Clarity

- Are escalation thresholds clear?
- Is sign-off authority consistently enforced?
- Are No-Ship decisions respected?
- Are override attempts resisted?

---

###  Incident Response Maturity

- Was containment immediate?
- Was RCA thorough?
- Were corrective actions durable?
- Were lessons integrated into governance?

## Retrospective Methodology

Retrospective review should:

1. Aggregate incident data  
2. Identify recurring themes  
3. Evaluate systemic exposure patterns  
4. Review governance decision consistency  
5. Identify structural improvement areas  

Retrospective must remain evidence-based.

---

## Retrospective Outputs

Each retrospective must produce:

- Identified control strengths
- Identified control weaknesses
- Governance update recommendations
- Monitoring adjustments
- Framework update proposals (if required)

Outputs must be documented and version-controlled.

---

## Governance Evolution Link

Retrospective findings may feed into:

- Taxonomy updates
- Category refinements
- Escalation protocol adjustments
- Monitoring threshold revisions
- Regression scope expansion
- Approval governance refinements

Retrospective review strengthens architecture.

---

## Documentation Requirements

Each retrospective record must include:

- Review scope
- Time window evaluated
- Incident summary data
- Identified themes
- Improvement actions
- Governance approval confirmation

Traceability preserves institutional memory.

---

## Final Principle

Governance must be examined as rigorously as the system it governs.
Periodic retrospection ensures that:
- Controls do not stagnate
- Drift does not normalise
- Blind spots do not expand
- Authority remains clear

A mature governance system evolves deliberately, not reactively.
