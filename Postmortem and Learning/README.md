# Postmortem and Learning  
## Converting Incidents into Structural Improvement  

---

## Purpose

This directory defines how confirmed incidents and systemic failures are analysed beyond containment and correction.

- Incident Response restores safety.  
- Root Cause Analysis identifies underlying causes.  
- Postmortem ensures the system becomes stronger after failure.

Postmortem transforms isolated incidents into governance evolution.

Postmortem & Learning  

Postmortem completes the learning loop.

## Core Principles

1. Every critical incident must produce learning
2. Governance gaps must be identified explicitly
3. Structural improvements must be documented
4. Control weaknesses must be strengthened
5. Repeated failures must trigger systemic review

An incident without learning is governance waste.

## Objectives

Postmortem must:

- Evaluate adequacy of existing controls
- Identify monitoring sensitivity gaps
- Assess evaluation coverage gaps
- Determine escalation timeliness
- Strengthen prevention mechanisms
- Document institutional learning

Postmortem focuses on system improvement, not individual blame.

## Governance Intent

High-risk AI systems must improve over time.

Postmortem ensures that:

- Failure pathways shrink
- Detection improves
- Controls strengthen
- Blind spots reduce
- Governance maturity increases

Resilient systems are built through structured reflection.
